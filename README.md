# windgrid-dat

The windgrid dat scripts take a windgrid and create a Hazus dat file. 

This repo contains:
  - [x] an open-source script
  - [x] a proprietary script using ESRI's ArcPy and spatial extension
  - [x] base data tract centroids

<h2>To use</h2>

1. Scroll to the bottom of the script and replace the inputs
2. Run the whole script


<h2>Notes</h2>

* The open-source script utilizes the base data and does not need census tract centroids provided
* The proprietary tool does not utilize the base data and requires census tract centroids to be prepared prior to running
